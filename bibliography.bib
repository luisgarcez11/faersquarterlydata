abstract = {Purpose: A continuous systematic review of all combinations of drugs and suspected adverse reactions (ADRs) reported to a spontaneous reporting system, is necessary to optimize signal detection. To focus attention of human reviewers, quantitative procedures can be used to sift data in different ways. In various centres, different measures are used to quantify the extent to which an ADR is reported disproportionally to a certain drug compared to the generality of the database. The objective of this study is to examine the level of concordance of the various estimates to the measure used by the WHO Collaborating Centre for International ADR monitoring, the information component (IC), when applied to the dataset of the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Foundation Lareb. Methods: The Reporting Odds Ratio - 1.96 standard errors (SE), proportional reporting ratio - 1.96 SE, Yule's Q - 1.96 SE, the Poisson probability and Chi-square test of all 17 330 combinations were compared with the IC minus 2 standard deviations. Additionally, the concordance of the various tests, in respect to the number of reports per combination, was examined. Results: In general, sensitivity was high in respect to the reference measure when a combination of point- and precision estimate was used. The concordance increased dramatically when the number of reports per combination increased. Conclusion: This study shows that the different measures used are broadly comparable when four or more cases per combination have been collected.

abstract = {Background. The process of generating 'signals' of possible unrecognized hazards from spontaneous adverse drug reaction reporting data has been likened to looking for a needle in a haystack. However, statistical approaches to the data have been underutilised. Methods. Using the UK Yellow Card database, we have developed and evaluated a statistical aid to signal generation called a Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR). The proportion of all reactions to a drug which are for a particular medical condition of interest is compared to the same proportion for all drugs in the database, in a 2 × 2 table. We investigated a group of newly-marketed drugs using as minimum criteria for a signal, 3 or more cases, PRR at least 2, chi-squared of at least 4. Findings. The database was used to examine retrospectively 15 drugs newly-marketed in the UK, with the highest levels of ADR reporting. The method identified 481 signals meeting the minimum criteria during the period 1996-8. Further evaluation of these showed that 70% were known adverse reactions, 13% were events which were likely to be related to the underlying disease and 17% were signals requiring further evaluation. Implications. Proportional reporting ratios are a valuable aid to signal generation from spontaneous reporting data which are easy to calculate and interpret, and various refinements are possible. {\textcopyright} Crown copyright 2001.

@article{Khaleel2022,
abstract = {One of the largest spontaneous adverse events reporting databases in the world is the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Unfortunately, researchers face many obstacles in analyzing data from the FAERS database. One of the major obstacles is the unstructured entry of drug names into the FAERS, as reporters might use generic names or trade names with different naming structures from all over the world and, in some cases, with typographical errors. Moreover, report duplication is a known problem in spontaneous adverse event-reporting systems, including the FAERS database. Hence, thorough text processing for database entries, especially drug name entries, coupled with a practical case-deduplication logic, is a prerequisite to analyze the database, which is a time-and resource-consuming procedure. In this study, we provide a clean, deduplicated, and ready-to-import dataset into any relational database management software of the FAERS database up to September 2021. Drug names are standardized to the RxNorm vocabulary and normalized to the single active ingredient level. Moreover, a pre-calculated disproportionate analysis is provided, which includes the reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), Chi-squared analysis with Yates correction (x2), and information component (IC) for each drug-adverse event pair in the database.},
